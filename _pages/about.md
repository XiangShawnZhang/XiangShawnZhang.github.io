<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto Scarborough, working with Prof. [Patricia Romero-Lankao](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/52972-patricia-romerolankao) on the Canadian Excellence in Research Chair project for the Network for Equity in Sustainability Transitions [(CERC NEST)](https://climatehealth.utoronto.ca/initiative/the-cerc-network-for-equity-in-sustainability-transitions/). My current research centers on the quantitative assessment of climate vulnerability, energy dynamics, and equity in sustainable transitions, using a comparative analysis across multiple cities.
<br>
Before joining the University of Toronto, I earned my Doctoral Degree in Geography at McGill University, where I was supervised by Prof.
 [Brian E Robinson](https://brianerobinson.com/) and Prof. [Christopher Barrington-Leigh](https://wellbeing.research.mcgill.ca/index.php?m=about). My doctoral dissertation examined the well-being impacts of the "Clean Heating Program" in rural North China. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master’s degree at the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Shiqiu Zhang](https://en.cese.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultybydepartment/departmentofmanagement/44/index.htm) and Prof. [Hancheng Dai](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/hanchengdai).<br>
 My research interests lie in Environmental Economics, Well-being, and Policy Evaluation, with a particular focus on the equity impacts of environmental and energy policies. My work has been published in international journals in various fields, including energy, environment, transportation, and health.
